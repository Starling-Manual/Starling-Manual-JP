== Starling の設定

Starling を使ったアプリケーション作成の最初のステップです。
_Starling_ クラス (`starling.core` パッケージ下にあります。)のインスタンスを作ります。
コンストラクタの引数は以下のようになっています。

[source, as3]
----
public function Starling(
    rootClass:Class,
    stage:Stage,
    viewPort:Rectangle = null,
    stage3D:Stage3D = null,
    renderMode:String = auto,
    profile:Object = auto);
----

rootClass:: _Stage3D_ の初期化が終わったタイミングですぐにインスタンス化されるクラスです。
`starling.display.DisplayObject` のサブクラスでなくてはいけません。

stage:: いつもの Flash の stage です。Starling で参照が保持されます。
これによって Starling と Flash の ディスプレイリストがお互いに接続されるようになります。

viewPort:: Flash の stage 全体のうち、Starling が描画するエリアです。
stage と同じ大きさにされる事が多いため、値を指定しないか `null` を指定する事で、自動的に stage 全体の大きさが使われます。

stage3D:: 描画に使われる _Stage3D_ のインスタンスです。
全ての Flash の stage は複数の _Stage3D_ インスタンスを持つ事ができるため、そのうちの一つを選択する事ができます。
しかし、たいていの場合、デフォルトの null パラメータを渡せば（引数を省略すれば）十分です。
自動的に 利用可能な _Stage3D_ オブジェクトの最初の一つが Starling に利用されるようになります。

//原文：renderMode:: The whole idea behind _Stage3D_ is to provide hardware-accelerated rendering.
renderMode:: _Stage3D_ の背後にある全てのアイデアは、ハードウェアを使って描画を行う事です。
//原文：However, there is also a software fallback mode; it may be forced by passing `Context3DRenderMode.SOFTWARE`.
しかし、renderMode の引数に `Context3DRenderMode.SOFTWARE` を渡すごとにより、ソフトウェアのレンダリングモードに切り替えることもできます。
といってもデフォルトの `auto` 値が推奨されます。
`auto` 値の指定では、ハードウェアレンダリングが使えない状況のみ、自動でソフトウェアのレンダリングに切り替わります。

//原文：profile:: _Stage3D_ provides a set of capabilities that are grouped into different _profiles_
profile:: _Stage3D_ は、いくつかの _プロファイル_ 設定 として そのGPUの能力をいくつかのグループに振り分けます。
（ プロファイルは、Context3DProfile クラスの定数として設定されています。）
良いハードウェアの上でアプリが動いているほど、プロファイルも良いものが選択可能になります。
`auto` の設定では単純に一番良いプロファルを選択します。

たいていの引数はデフォルトの引数が適切に設定されています。よって全てを指定する必要はありません。
下記のコードは、Starling を実行するわかりやすい例です。
_Flash Player_ もしくは、_AIR_ プロジェクト用の _Main_ クラスを見ています。

[source, as3]
----
package
{
    import flash.display.Sprite;
    import starling.core.Starling;

    [SWF(width="640", height="480",
         backgroundColor="#808080",
         frameRate="60")]
    public class Main extends Sprite
    {
        private var _starling:Starling;

        public function Main()
        {
            _starling = new Starling(Game, stage);
            _starling.start();
        }
    }
}
----

ここで Main クラスが `flash.display.Sprite` を継承しており、Starling の Sprite を継承しているのでは無い事に注目してください。
_AS3_ で作られた全てのプロジェクトで _Main_ クラスはこのような形である必要があります。
//原文：the logic is moved over to the _Game_ class, which builds our link to the `starling.display` world.
しかし、Starling が初期化を終えるとすぐに、`starling.display` の世界を形作る _Game_ クラスに処理が移ります。

[NOTE]
.フレームレートの設定
====
いくつかの設定は class 定義より前の、"SWF" _MetaData_ タグで設定されています。フレームレートもそこで設定されます。
Starling 自体にはフレームレートの設定がありません、stage の _frameRate_ 値をそのまま利用します。
`nativeStage` 値は `nativeStage` のプロパティ経由で動的に変更することもできます。

[source, as3]
----
Starling.current.nativeStage.frameRate = 60;
----
====

Starling の初期化プロセスは非同期処理です。
これは、Main 命令の最後の段階ではまだ Game インスタンスにアクセスできない事を意味します。
Game インスタンスが作成されたタイミングは `ROOT_CREATED` を受け取ることで知る事ができます。

[source, as3]
----
public function Main()
{
    _starling = new Starling(Game, stage);
    _starling.addEventListener(Event.ROOT_CREATED, onRootCreated);
    _starling.start();
}

private function onRootCreated(event:Event, root:Game):void
{
    root.start(); // Game クラスには 'start' メソッドが定義されている前提です。
}
----

=== The ViewPort

_Stage3D_ provides Starling with a rectangular area to draw into.
That area can be anywhere within the native stage, which means: anywhere within the area of the _Flash Player_ or the application window (in case of an _AIR_ project).

In Starling, that area is called the _viewPort_.
Most of the time, you will want to use all of the available area, but sometimes it makes sense to limit rendering to a certain region.

Think of a game designed in an aspect ratio of 4:3, running on an 16:9 screen.
By centering the 4:3 _viewPort_ on the screen, you will end up with a "letterboxed" game, with black bars at the top and bottom.

// TODO: add image

You can't talk about the _viewPort_ without looking at Starling's _stage_, as well.
By default, the stage will be exactly the same size as the _viewPort_.
That makes a lot of sense, of course: a device with a display size of 1024 × 768 pixels should have an equally sized stage.

You can customize the stage size, though.
That's possible via the `stage.stageWidth` and `stage.stageHeight` properties:

[source, as3]
----
stage.stageWidth = 1024;
stage.stageHeight = 768;
----

But wait, what does that even mean?
Is the size of the drawing area now defined by the _viewPort_ or the _stage size_?

Don't worry, that area is still only set up by the _viewPort_, as described above.
Modifying the `stageWidth` and `stageHeight` doesn't change the size of the drawing area at all;
the stage is always stretched across the complete _viewPort_.
What you are changing, though, is the size of the stage's _coordinate system_.

That means that with a stage width of `1024`, an object with an x-coordinate of `1000` will be close to the right edge of the stage; no matter if the viewPort is `512`, `1024`, or `2048` pixels wide.

That becomes especially useful when developing for _HiDPI_ screens.
For example, Apple's _iPad_ exists in a normal and a "retina" version, the latter doubling the number of pixel rows and columns (yielding four times as many pixels).
On such a screen, the interface elements should not become smaller; instead, they should be rendered more crisply.

By differentiating between the _viewPort_ and the _stage size_, this is easily reproduced in Starling.
On both device types, the stage size will be 1024×768; the viewPort, on the other hand, will reflect the size of the screen in pixels.
The advantage: you can use the same coordinates for your display objects, regardless of the device on which the application is running.

[NOTE]
.Points vs. Pixels
====
If you think this through, you'll see that on such a retina device, an object with an x-coordinate of `1` will actually be two pixels away from the origin.
In other words, the unit of measurement has changed.
We are no longer talking about pixels, but _points_!
On a low-resolution screen, one point equals one pixel; on a HiDPI screen, it's two pixels (or more, depending on the device).
====

To find out the actual width (in pixels) of a point, you can simply divide `viewPort.width` by `stage.stageWidth`.
Or you use Starling's `contentScaleFactor` property, which does just that.

[source, as3]
----
starling.viewPort.width = 2048;
starling.stage.stageWidth = 1024;
trace(starling.contentScaleFactor); // -> 2.0
----

I will show you how to make full use of this concept in the <<Mobile Development>> chapter.

=== Context3D Profiles

The platforms Starling is running on feature a wide variety of graphics processors.
Of course, those GPUs have different capabilities.
The question is: how to differentiate between those capabilities at runtime?

That's what _Context3D profiles_ (also called _render profiles_) are for.

[NOTE]
.What is a Context3D?
====
When using _Stage3D_, you are interacting with a rendering pipeline that features a number of properties and settings.
The _context_ is the object that encapsulate that pipeline.
Creating a texture, uploading shaders, rendering triangles -- that's all done through the context.
====

Actually, Starling makes every effort to hide any profile limitations from you.
To ensure the widest possible reach, it was designed to work even with the lowest available profile.
At the same time, when running in a higher profile, it will automatically make best use of it.

Nevertheless, it might prove useful to know about their basic features.
Here's an overview of each profile, starting with the lowest.

`BASELINE_CONSTRAINED`:: If a device supports Stage3D at all, it must support this profile. It comes with several mean limitations, e.g. it only supports textures with side-lengths that are powers of two, and the length of shaders is very limited. That profile is mainly found on old desktop computers.

`BASELINE`:: The minimum profile to be found on mobile devices. Starling runs well with this profile; the removal of the power-of-two limitation allows for more efficient memory usage, and the length of shader programs is easily sufficient for its needs.

`BASLINE_EXTENDED`:: Raises the maximum texture size from `2048x2048` to `4096x4096` pixels, which is crucial for high-resolution devices.

`STANDARD_CONSTRAINED`, `STANDARD`, `STANDARD_EXTENDED`:: Starling currently doesn't need any of the features coming with these profiles. They provide additional shader commands and other low-level enhancements.

My recommendation: simply let Starling pick the best available profile (`auto`) and let it deal with the implications.

[NOTE]
.Maximum Texture Size
====
There's only one thing you need to take care of yourself: making sure that your textures are not too big.
The maximum texture size is accessible via the property `Texture.maxSize`, but only _after_ Starling has finished initializing.
====

=== Native Overlay

The main idea behind Starling is to speed up rendering with its Stage3D driven API.
However, there's no denying it: the classic display list has many features that Starling simply can't offer.
Thus, it makes sense to provide an easy way to mix-and-match features of Starling and classic Flash.

The `nativeOverlay` property is the easiest way to do so.
That's a conventional `flash.display.Sprite` that lies directly on top of Starling, taking _viewPort_ and _contentScaleFactor_ into account.
If you need to use conventional Flash objects, add them to this overlay.

Beware, though, that conventional Flash content on top of _Stage3D_ can lead to performance penalties on some (mobile) platforms. For that reason, always remove all objects from the overlay when you don't need them any longer.

[NOTE]
====
Before you ask: no, you can't add any conventional display objects _below_ Starling display objects.
The Stage3D surface is always at the bottom; there's no way around that.
====

=== Skipping Unchanged Frames

It happens surprisingly often in an application or game that a scene stays completely static for several frames.
The application might be presenting a static screen or wait for user input, for example.
So why redraw the stage at all in those situations?

That's exactly the point of the `skipUnchangedFrames`-property.
If enabled, static scenes are recognized as such and the back buffer is simply left as it is.
On a mobile device, the impact of this feature can't be overestimated.
There's simply no better way to enhance battery life!

I'm already hearing your objection: if this feature is so useful, why isn't it activated by default?
There must be a catch, right?

Indeed, there is: it doesn't work well with _Render-_ and _VideoTextures_.
Changes in those textures simply won't show up.
It's easy to work around that, though: either disable `skipUnchangedFrames` temporarily while using them, or call `stage.setRequiresRedraw()` whenever their content changes.

Now that you know about this feature, make it a habit to always activate it!
In the meantime, I hope that I can solve the mentioned problems in a future Starling version.

IMPORTANT: On mobile platforms, there's another limitation you should be aware of: as soon as there's any content on the native (Flash) stage (e.g. via Starling's `nativeOverlay`), Starling can't skip any frames.
That's the consequence of a Stage3D limitation.

=== The Statistics Display

When developing an application, you want as much information as possible about what's going on.
That way, you will be able to spot problems early and maybe avoid running into a dead end later.
The statistics display helps with that.

[source, as3]
----
_starling.showStats = true;
----

.The statistics display (by default at the top left).
image::stats-display.png[The statistics display]

What's the meaning of those values?

* The _framerate_ should be rather self-explanatory: the number of frames Starling managed to render during the previous second.
* _Standard memory_ is, in a nutshell, what your _AS3_ objects fill up. Whether it's a _String_, a _Sprite_, a _Bitmap_, or a _Function_: all objects require some memory.
  The value is given in megabytes.
* _GPU memory_ is separate from that. Textures are stored in graphics memory, as are vertex buffers and shader programs.
  Most of the time, textures will overshadow everything else.
* The number of _draw calls_ indicates how many individual "draw"-commands are sent to the GPU in each frame.
  Typically, a scene renders faster when there are fewer draw calls.
  We will look in detail at this value when we talk about <<Performance Optimization>>.

You might notice that the background color of the statistics display alternates between black and dark green.
That's a subtle clue that's referring to the `skipUnchangedFrames` property:
whenever the majority of the last couple of frames could be skipped, the box turns green.
Make sure that it stays green whenever the stage is static; if it doesn't, some logic is preventing frame skipping to kick in.

TIP: You can customize the location of the statistics display on the screen via the method `showStatsAt`.
