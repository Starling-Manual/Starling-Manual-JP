== ATF テクスチャ

従来の Flash 開発では、ほとんどの開発者が画像として _PNG_ フォーマットを用いるか、透明度が必要ない場合は _JPG_ フォーマットを用います。
それらは Starling でも同様にとても一般的なやり方です。
しかし、_Stage3D_ はまた別の、いくつかの優れた特徴を持つ画像フォーマットに対応しています。_Adobe Texture Format_ という圧縮したテクスチャ情報を保持できるフォーマットです。

//原文：* Compressed textures require just a fraction of their conventional counterparts.
* 圧縮されたテクスチャは従来のテクスチャと比べてわずかなサイズとなります。
* 解凍作業は GPU によって直接行われます。
* グラフィックメモリーへのアップロードがより高速です。
* アップロードは非同期に行うことができます。ゲーム体験を損なわずにテクスチャをロードすることができます。.footnote:[AIR 24 と Starling 2.2 より、同じことを通常のテクスチャでも行う事ができます。]

=== グラフィックメモリー

ATF テクスチャの話を続ける前に、どのくらいのメモリーがテクスチャによって必要となるか知っておくのも良いでしょう。

１枚の PNG 画像は、１ドットごとに4つのチャンネル情報を保持します。_赤_、_緑_、_青_、_透明度_ で、それぞれが８ビットの（つまり256段階の）情報を持ちます。
512 x 512 ピクセルのテクスチャーがどれだけの領域を必要とするのか計算するのは難しくありません。

====
512 × 512 サイズの RGBA テクスチャのメモリ容量: +
512 × 512 ピクセル × 4 bytes = 1,048,576 bytes ≈ 1 MB
====

_JPG_ イメージを使っている場合はもっと小さくなります。アルファチャンネルが必要なくなるためです。

====
512 × 512 サイズの RGB テクスチャのメモリ容量: +
512 × 512 ピクセル × 3 bytes = 786,432 bytes ≈ 768 kB
====

こんなに小さなテクスチャのためにとても大きな容量を必要としていますね？
//原文：Beware that the built-in file compression of _PNG_ and _JPG_ does not help: the image has to be decompressed before _Stage3D_ can handle it.
_PNG_ や _JPG_ フォーマットで圧縮された画像は _Stage3D_ が扱うために一度解凍されざるを得ないわけです。

言い換えれば、ファイルサイズは問題ではないのです。メモリ使用量は上記の計算式によっていつでも決定されます。
//原文：Nevertheless: if your textures easily fit into graphics memory that way -- go ahead and use them!
とはいえ、それでもうまくメモリに収まるのであれば、そのまま使って良いでしょう。
//原文：Those formats are very easy to work with and will be fine in many situations, especially if your application is targeting desktop hardware.
特にデスクトップPCをターゲットとしたアプリケーションを作成しているのなら、それでたいていの場合とてもうまくワークします。

しかし、開発が進むとデバイスで利用可能な容量以上にメモリ消費がなされてしまう瞬間もやってくる事でしょう。
その時が、ATF フォーマットを試してみるべき時です。

=== Compressed Textures

Above, we learned that the file size of a conventional texture has nothing to do with how much graphics memory it uses; a massively compressed _JPG_ will take up just as much space as the same image in pure _BMP_ format.

This is not true for compressed textures: they can be processed directly on the GPU.
This means that, depending on the compression settings, you can load up to ten times as many textures.
Quite impressive, right?

Unfortunately, each GPU vendor thought he could do better than the others, and so there are several different formats for compressed textures.
In other words: depending on where your game is running, it will need a different kind of texture.
How should you know beforehand which file to include?

This where ATF comes to the rescue.
It is a format that Adobe created especially for _Stage3D_; actually, it is a container file that can include up to four different versions of a texture.

* *PVRTC* (PowerVR Texture Compression) is used in PowerVR GPUs. It is supported by all generations of the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad.
* *DXT1/5* (S3 Texture Compression) was originally developed by S3 Graphics. It is now supported by both Nvidia and AMD GPUs, and is thus available on most desktop computers, as well as some Android phones.
* *ETC* (Ericsson Texture Compression) is used on many mobile phones, most notably on Android.
* *ETC2* provides higher quality RGB and RGBA compression. It is supported by all Android and iOS devices that also support OpenGL ES 3.

I wrote before that ATF is a _container_ format. That means that it can include any combination of the the above formats.

.An ATF file is actually a container for other formats.
image::atf-container.png[ATF container]

When you include all formats (which is the default), the texture can be loaded on any Stage3D-supporting device, no matter if your application is running on iOS, Android, or on the Desktop.
You don't have to care about the internals!

However, if you know that your game will only be deployed to, say, iOS devices, you can omit all formats except PVRTC.
Or if you're only targeting high end mobile devices (with at least _OpenGL ES 3_), include only ETC2; that works on both Android and iOS.
That way, you can optimize the download size of your game.

[NOTE]
====
The difference between DXT1 and DXT5 is just that the latter supports an alpha channel.
Don't worry about this, though: the ATF tools will choose the right format automatically.

ETC1 actually does not support an alpha channel, but Stage3D works around this by using two textures internally. Again, this happens completely behind the scenes.

=== Creating an ATF texture

Adobe provides a set of command line tools to convert to and from ATF and to preview the generated files.
They are part of the AIR SDK (look for the `atftools` folder).

Probably the most important tool is `png2atf`.
Here is a basic usage example; it will compress the texture with the standard settings in all available formats.

----
png2atf -c -i texture.png -o texture.atf
----

If you tried that out right away, you probably received the following error message, though:

----
Dimensions not a power of 2!
----

That's a limitation I have not mentioned yet: ATF textures are required to always have side-lengths that are powers of two.
While this is a little annoying, it's actually rarely a problem, since you will almost always use them for atlas textures.

TIP: Most atlas generators can be configured so that they create power-of-two textures.

When the call succeeds, you can review the output in the _ATFViewer_.

.The _ATFViewer_ tool.
image::atf-viewer.png[ATFViewer]

In the list on the left, you can choose which internal format you want to view.
Furthermore, you see that, per default, all mipmap variants have been created.

NOTE: We will discuss mipmaps in the <<Memory Management>> chapter.

You will probably also notice that the image quality has suffered a bit from the compression.
This is because all those compression formats are _lossy_: the smaller memory footprint comes at the prize of a reduced quality.
How much the quality suffers is depending on the type of image: while organic, photo-like textures work well, comic-like images with hard edges can suffer quite heavily.

The tool provides a lot of different options, of course.
E.g. you can let it package only the PVRTC format, perfect for iOS:

----
png2atf -c p -i texture.png -o texture.atf
----

Or you can tell it to omit mipmaps in order to save memory:

----
png2atf -c -n 0,0 -i texture.png -o texture.atf
----

Another useful utility is called `atfinfo`.
It displays details about the data that's stored in a specific ATF file, like the included texture formats, the number of mipmaps, etc.

----
> atfinfo -i texture.atf

File Name          : texture.atf
ATF Version        : 2
ATF File Type      : RAW Compressed With Alpha (DXT5+ETC1/ETC1+PVRTV4bpp)
Size               : 256x256
Cube Map           : no
Empty Mipmaps      : no
Actual Mipmaps     : 1
Embedded Levels    : X........ (256x256)
AS3 Texture Class  : Texture (flash.display3D.Texture)
AS3 Texture Format : Context3DTextureFormat.COMPRESSED_ALPHA
----

=== Using ATF Textures

Using a compressed texture in Starling is just as simple as any other texture.
Pass the byte array with the file contents to the factory method `Texture.fromAtfData()`.

[source, as3]
----
var atfData:ByteArray = getATFBytes(); // <1>
var texture:Texture = Texture.fromATFData(atfData); // <2>
var image:Image = new Image(texture); // <3>
----
<1> Get the raw data e.g. from a file.
<2> Create the ATF texture.
<3> Use it like any other texture.

That's it! This texture can be used like any other texture in Starling.
It's also a perfectly suitable candidate for your atlas texture.

However, the code above will upload the texture synchronously, i.e. AS3 execution will pause until that's done.
To load the texture asynchronously instead, pass a callback to the method:

[source, as3]
----
Texture.fromATFData(atfData, 1, true,
    function(texture:Texture):void
    {
        var image:Image = new Image(texture);
    });
----

Parameters two and three control the scale factor and if mipmaps should be used, respectively.
The fourth one, if passed a callback, will trigger asynchronous loading: Starling will be able to continue rendering undisturbed while that happens.
As soon as the callback has been executed (but not any sooner!), the texture will be usable.

Of course, you can also embed the ATF file directly in the AS3 source.

[source, as3]
----
[Embed(source="texture.atf", mimeType="application/octet-stream")]
public static const CompressedData:Class;

var texture:Texture = Texture.fromEmbeddedAsset(CompressedData);
----

Note, however, that asynchronous upload is not available in this case.
